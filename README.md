# Explore bikeshare data using R

## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring bikeshare trip data from multiple U.S. cities using R. The goal is to analyze trip durations, popular days of the week for different user types, and seasonal trends in rentals. This exploration provides insights into user behavior and bikeshare usage patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **R**: Primary programming language.
- **Packages**: `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `ggplot2` for data manipulation and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on individual bikeshare rides, including:
- **Start Time**: The time the trip started.
- **End Time**: The time the trip ended.
- **Trip Duration**: The length of each trip in seconds.
- **Start and End Stations**: The bikeshare stations where trips started and ended.
- **User Type**: Whether the rider is a Subscriber (long-term) or Customer (short-term).

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Cleaning**: Loaded the raw data, handled missing values, and standardized formats.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Calculated average trip durations for each city and overall.
   - Analyzed popular days for both user types.
   - Identified peak rental days and seasonal patterns in trip volume.
3. **Visualization**: Used `ggplot2` to create visual representations of trip durations, popular days, and rental activity throughout the year.

## Results

- Average trip lengths are mostly under 30 minutes, with short trips being the norm.
- Subscribers prefer weekday trips, peaking on Wednesdays, while single-ride customers are more active on weekends.
- Rentals peak during the Spring months, with the most popular rental days varying slightly between cities.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a clear understanding of how bikeshare systems are utilized across cities and times of the year. The findings can be used to optimize system planning and improve the user experience.
